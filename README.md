# Overview

This repository is dedicated to the experimental phase of our project, where we develop, train, and evaluate models to decode and interpret obscure Korean text into its intended meaning. These experiments are essential for testing the effectiveness and accuracy of our natural language processing (NLP) models.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to conduct experiments on various model architectures and configurations, using the datasets collected in the data repository. The results from these experiments will guide the optimization and refinement of our models.

## Future Direction

In the future, we plan to extend our experiments to include models for other languages, enabling cross-linguistic capabilities and broader applications for our NLP solutions.

## Contents

- Scripts for training and evaluating NLP models
- Configuration files for various model architectures
- Documentation of experimental results and findings
